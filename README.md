## Professional Narrative

With over 20 years of international experience, my career has been dedicated to advancing sustainable land management through innovative soil science, digital soil mapping, and remote sensing technologies. I earned my PhD from Wageningen University and ISRICâ€“World Soil Information in 2018, specializing in Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) for digital soil mapping. My research was recognized internationally when awarded the prestigious "Best Paper in Pedometrics" by the International Union of Soil Sciences.

Throughout my career, I have thrived in diverse international environments, leading multidisciplinary teams and fostering strategic partnerships. At the FAO, I have coordinated and contributed significantly to global initiatives such as the Soil Atlas of Asia, GSNmap, GBSmap, and the SoilFER project. My leadership in these projects has enabled the creation and improvement of national soil information systems across Asia, Central America, and the Caribbean. I have personally facilitated numerous workshops and trainings, notably in Bhutan, Vietnam, Guatemala, Honduras, and Trinidad & Tobago, directly impacting local capabilities in digital soil mapping, soil data management, and sustainable agricultural practices.

Recently, I have been leading the development of a novel AI-powered decision support system that integrates soil spatial data with artificial intelligence to deliver actionable insights to farmers, advisors, and policymakers. This initiative, currently under the prototype stage, leverages cloud-based geospatial platforms, national soil maps, and Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities to provide natural-language responses to soil management questions. By transforming complex environmental data into clear, location-specific advice, this project enhances accessibility, decision-making, and capacity in sustainable land management. The platform is being piloted with 13 countries in Asia and 8 in the Caribbean and is poised for broader application.

My global engagements have consistently emphasized collaboration with stakeholders from government ministries, international NGOs, and research institutions. Notably, my contributions have included:

* Leading comprehensive workshops in Bhutan, enhancing regional capabilities in soil data harmonization, database management, and web mapping.
* Coordinating the SoilFER project's inception and implementation workshops in Guatemala and Honduras, focusing on strengthening local laboratories and sustainable soil management practices.
* Facilitating hands-on digital soil mapping workshops in Trinidad & Tobago and Vietnam, significantly improving regional capacities and establishing vibrant, collaborative networks among Caribbean and Asian soil scientists.

One of the most memorable and impactful professional experiences was organizing the Soil Information Systems workshop in Bhutan. Working closely with FAO Bhutan, government technicians, and FAO Rome colleagues, I coordinated the agenda, trainer activities, local logistics, and facilitated the participation of delegates from all 13 AFACI countries. I ensured participants received travel support, visas, and timely communication. The gratitude expressed by the organizers and participants was deeply meaningful. My role extended beyond logistics, as I represented the Global Soil Partnership in high-level meetings, including one attended by FAOâ€™s DG Representative, the FAO Regional Office, and EU donor delegates. I also participated in bilateral meetings with the Bhutan Minister of Agriculture. These experiences showcased my solution-oriented mindset and ability to deliver impactful results through pragmatic approaches.

Additionally, my participation in high-level international conferences, such as the Global Soil Partnership meetings (Rome), G20 Agricultural Chief Scientists meetings, and various international pedometrics conferences, has broadened my global perspective and deepened my professional network.

Driven by a passion for sustainable agriculture and environmental stewardship, my mission remains clear: to bridge advanced scientific methodologies with practical, impactful land management solutions, ensuring sustainability and resilience for future generations.
